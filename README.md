As nothing in this service meant to be exported (no grpc service declarations for example) no real benefit in using internal.
model timestamps and pagination are kinda next step, I add those only if explicitly necessary
Indices in db are most obvious, need for something more specific rely on domain knowledge.
Shift hours are dynamic.
